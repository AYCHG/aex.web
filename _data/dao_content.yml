- title: What is the Bisq DAO?
  intro: The Bisq DAO enables Bisq to manage funding and decision-making without the confines of a corporation or other legal entity, keeping Bisq stateless & sovereign.

- title: What the Bisq DAO is not
  intro: "The Bisq DAO is NOT a tool to raise capital. Bisq already makes revenue from trading fees.
          <br><br>
          The Bisq DAO (and BSQ token) merely change the distribution of those trading fees.
          <br><br>
          Right now, they only go to arbitrators. With the DAO, they can be distributed to all project contributors, on merit, without any central authorities."

  intro: "<div class=\"subtitle\">Traders Save  Money:</div>
    <div class=\"small\">
      When the DAO is live, you'll be able to pay trading fees with BSQ.
      <ul>
        <li>Save money by paying trading fees in BSQ instead of BTC</li>
        <li>Support the continuous development of Bisq by buying BSQ from contributors</li>
        <li>You can still pay trading fees with plain BTC if you like (but you'll miss out on the hefty discount of BSQ)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class=\"subtitle\">Contributors Earn Money:</div>
    <div class=\"small\">
      When the DAO is live, you'll earn BSQ for your work.
      <ul>
        <li>Do valuable work, request compensation, receive BSQ</li>
        <li>Sell BSQ to traders to get paid</li>
        <li>Vote on compensation requests of other contributors</li>
        <li>Do more work, help grow the network, and do it all again!</li>
      </ul>

- title: Why?
  intro: "Bisq trading is currently decentralized, but its funding and decision-making is not.
          <br><br>
          It is critical that Bisq be resistant to censorship, and the trade protocol and P2P network achieve this—for traders.
          <br><br>
          What about Bisq's developers? Project decision-making and funding is still centralized, and this creates vulnerabilities."

- title: How does it work?
  intro: "The Bisq DAO has 2 primary purposes: decision-making and funding.
          <div class=\"subtitle pt-4\">
            Bisq DAO decision-making
          </div>
          <div class=\"small\">
            <p>
              With no CEO or central leadership team, DAO voting (social consensus) is what determines Bisq's project strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bisq stakeholders—traders and contributors—vote on proposals to determine Bisq strategy, compensation, and other policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              This gives Bisq's users (like you!) influence in the direction of the project. Want to change the trade protocol? Adjust fees? Make a proposal. Voting takes place right in Bisq every month.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class=\"subtitle\">
            Bisq DAO funding
          </div>
          <div class=\"small pb-0\">
          The BSQ token does NOT raise capital. It's merely a tool to redirect trading fees (that currently all go to one place) to all Bisq contributors without any central party to collect them first.
          </div>"
