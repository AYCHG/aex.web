- Provide Bitcoin full nodes from Bisq developers (https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/39) to protect against BitcoinJ vulnerabilities (BitcoinJ is blindly following longest PoW chain and not checking consensus rule violations). That also avoids the privacy issues with bloom filters. (https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/issues/999)

- Lower miner fees by fee estimation adjustments (using maxDelay 20 instead of 10 and taking average of 12 last fee results)
- Lower miner fee by transaction size calculation. Instead of using 600 bytes as estimation of trade fee tx we create a dummy tx to get the exact size id funds are on the wallet, otherwise we use 260 bytes for maker and 320 bytes for taker (deposit and payout tx are larger).
- Reduce security deposit: DEFAULT_BUYER_SECURITY_DEPOSIT from 0.03 BTC to 0.01 BTC; MAX_BUYER_SECURITY_DEPOSIT from 0.2 BTC 0.05 BTC, MIN_BUYER_SECURITY_DEPOSIT from 0.001 BTC to 0.0005 BTC; SELLER_SECURITY_DEPOSIT from 0.01 BTC to 0.003 BTC

### Version 0.5.3
Released [July 17th 2017](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-desktop/releases/tag/v0.5.3)
 - The change of the application name from "bisq" to "Bisq" caused a change of the application directory as well. That caused on Linux that users wallet and data have been in the "bisq" and the app creates a new "Bisq" folder. To fix that we rename the application directory from "bisq" to "Bisq" if "Bisq" did not exist. If both already existed (if user has run 0.5.2.) we rename "Bisq" to "Bisq_backup" and "bisq" to "Bisq" assuming that the app dir with the current wallet and data was"bisq" from version 0.5.1. If case the user used the wallet and data now in "Bisq_backup" he has to move the folders content manually to the "Bisq" folder.

 - Support multiple base currencies. Beside BTC the user can choose to use LTC or DOGE as base market. More will come in future releases.
 - Use fee estimation service form https://bitcoinfees.21.co to use dynamic mining fees.
 - Use dynamic trading fees. Trading fees are based on trade amount and distance to market price.
Min. fee (MF) = 0.0002 BTC, default fee (DF) = 0.002 BTC, amount factor (AF) = 1/BTC, market price factor (MF) = square root of percent value (e.g. 1% -> 1, 9% 0 -> 3, 0.01% -> 0.1). Trading fee = max(MF, DF * amount * AF * MF). E.g. 0.002 BTC for 1 BTC trade at 1% market price distance.
