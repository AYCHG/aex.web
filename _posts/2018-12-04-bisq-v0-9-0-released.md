Bisq version 0.9.0 has been released. It's one of the biggest updates to Bisq ever, with DAO functionality on testnet and a striking new visual design, among a host of other improvements and bug fixes.

The Bisq DAO—the mechanism that will enable decentralized governance and funding of the Bisq exchange—will soon be going live on mainnet. To prepare for that launch, core DAO functionality is enabled on testnet in this new release. You can buy BSQ tokens, use them to make a compensation request, and vote on other requests.

For a more detailed background & walkthrough on how to explore the Bisq DAO on testnet, check out our [User's Introduction to the Bisq DAO](https://docs.bisq.network/user-dao-intro.html) doc.
