# Contribute to Bisq


### Bisq is an open source project powered entirely by volunteers. In the spirit of open source, we have opted to create Bisq without the demands or influence of investors.

Each of us is involved in the project because we personally believe in it! This is not just another Bitcoin Startup, this is a project aiming to be driven by the community and serving the community.
